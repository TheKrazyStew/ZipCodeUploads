# ZipCodeUploads
The purpose of this project was to:
- read an export of ZIP codes from a database's file,
- sort them to appropriate USPS distribution centers,
- tally the count of each distribution center,
- and output the results to determine the cost for each mailing.

Mailing costs are determined by the number of ZIP codes tallied into each distribution center.
ZIP code breakdown and distribution center groupings were given by the client per USPS specifications.
